# A collection of some projects
This repository is for the scientific projects that I find worth pursuing or interesting to implement with numerics. The scope is not restricted to only quantum condensed matter physics. Instead, it can be anything within the broad territory of science, including quantum computing, quantum chemistry, atomic physics, etc.
